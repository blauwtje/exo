# Changelog

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). A
skill's trigger, a skill or agent name, and the `exo:` namespace are the public
surface: renaming or removing one is a breaking change, adding one is a minor
release, and a body rewrite that keeps the trigger is a patch.

Versions before 0.134.8 are in [CHANGELOG-archive.md](CHANGELOG-archive.md).

## Unreleased

### Changed
- A weekly scheduled run cuts a release when `## Unreleased` holds an entry.
- A push to `main` cuts no release; `gh workflow run release.yml` cuts one on demand, with an optional `level` input.

## 0.135.0 - 2026-10-15

### Added
- run.json `promptCacheTtl` picks a 5-minute (default) or 1-hour prompt cache for detached run sessions.

### Fixed
- The sandboxed task prompt says any output restarts the 60-second silence count, so a slow Proof that prints progress runs.

## 0.134.16 - 2026-10-15

### Fixed
- A resumed retry adds only its own cost to the run budget and session log, not the first try's cost again.

## 0.134.15 - 2026-10-15

### Changed
- `npm run check` fails when a changelog line added since the last release sits under a released `## <version>` heading.

### Fixed
- A detached run's task session runs land-task's code-rule check through `--code-rules` on its task files before it ends, and fixes every finding.
- A pinned plan session can run `land-task.mjs --code-rules` on any task of its plan and sees every finding, and the changelog placement check fails when its `git diff` fails.

## 0.134.14 - 2026-10-14

### Fixed
- A detached run checks the tracked tree for changes twice, not three times, and run-plan preflight runs plan-check again after the plan-check script changes.

## 0.134.13 - 2026-10-14

### Fixed
- A run skips four repeated steps: a full task session after a no-red repair, a Proof rerun after the decisions file changes, repeated commit-log reads on resume, and a repeated preflight plan-check on an unchanged plan and HEAD.

## 0.134.12 - 2026-10-14

### Fixed
- A land refused for a code rule now lists every code-rule limit, so a retry no longer fixes one rule and breaks another.

## 0.134.11 - 2026-10-14

### Changed
- A retry after a failed land resumes that task's failed session with only the retry note, instead of a fresh session that rereads the plan, brief and files.

## 0.134.10 - 2026-10-14

### Fixed
- `exo:build` runs a plan's Success command once per tree when red-green is on: the final verify and a resume on an unchanged tree reuse red-green's recorded pass instead of running it again.

## 0.134.9 - 2026-10-14

### Fixed
- `exo:build` run reports count each model call's tokens once instead of once per content block, so per-task and total token figures no longer come out about 2.4x too high.
- `/exo:prompt` opens the rewrite's fenced block with at least three backticks, so a rewrite with no backticks or only inline code still renders as a code block.

## 0.134.8 - 2026-10-14

### Fixed
- `/exo:prompt` puts the goal and code facts in a `<background>` block instead of `<context>`, since Claude Code drops a `<context>` block when you copy the rewrite from the terminal.
